# Eagle's Rubik's Engine

Eagle's Rubik's Engine is a set of tools for working with the Rubik's Cube and similar puzzles. So far it is possible to work with the following puzzles:
- 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube
- 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube
- 3x3x3 Cubix Tube

The framework is easily extensible to represent other cube-type puzzles.

## Get Started

Using npm:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build```
- open ```dist/index.html``` to see the functionality in web app form

## Contributing

I'm not currently accepting pull requests, but feel free to fork the project or send me comments or suggestions.

## Future

I'm working on a solver algorithm, adding additional puzzle variants, and improving the user interface.
